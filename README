Degrees of separation experiment with Last.fm similar artists and Spotify tracks

Run like so:

python music_tour.py 'The Beatles' 'The Hey Chinaskis'

It might take a while. Requires pymongo and a mongodb instance (assumed to be at localhost on local port but can be overridden via mongo_config.py)
